    Generates the 1D Meyer wavelet in the Fourier domain associated with the
    scale segment [wn, wm] with a transition ratio `gamma`.

    :param wn: The lower boundary of the frequency segment.
    :param wm: The upper boundary of the frequency segment.
    :param gamma: The transition ratio that controls the width of the transition zones
                  between frequency bands.
    :param Nsig: The number of points in the signal.

    :returns:
        - ymw: The Fourier transform of the wavelet for the frequency band [wn, wm].

    This function creates a Meyer wavelet in the Fourier domain with smooth transitions
    between frequency bands defined by `wn` and `wm`.
