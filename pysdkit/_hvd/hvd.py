    Hilbert Vibration Decomposition

    The Hilbert Vibration Decomposition is an adaptive/data-driven separation of a multi-component non-stationary vibration signal into simple quasi-harmonic components.
    The method is characterized by high frequency and amplitude resolution, which provides  a comprehensive account of the case of amplitude and frequency modulated vibration analysis.
    The HVD is a simple and fast recursive vibration mode decomposition, that sifts out a 1D input signal into a set of k-band separated simplest components with their envelopes and instantaneous frequencies.
    The HVD decomposes composition as a vector and returns a matrix of inherent components as the Hilbert spectrum plus residual signal.

    The original code has a serious endpoint problem.
    The algorithm provided cannot handle the signal decomposition near the endpoint well.
    Therefore, we have improved it by mirroring the input signal to alleviate this problem.
    It can work only with narrowband signals!
