    Calculate the permutation entropy of the input time series of signal.

    Permutation entropy is essentially concerned with the complexity of local temporal structures (i.e., short-term dynamics).
    Permutation entropy is a method to measure the complexity of time series, which is often used to analyze nonlinear and chaotic systems.
    The core idea of permutation entropy is to measure the degree of chaos of time series through the permutation pattern (i.e. the order of data points).

    Calculate the Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MPE) of input time series or signal.

    Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MPE) is an extended method based on Permutation Entropy (PE).
    It captures the multi-scale characteristics of signals by calculating the permutation entropy of time series at different time scales,
    thereby providing a more comprehensive description of the complexity of the system.

    In traditional permutation entropy, the complexity of the original time series is calculated.
    Multiscale permutation entropy can capture the complexity of the signal at different time scales by calculating it at multiple different time scales.

    Multiscale permutation entropy (MPE) can provide the complexity characteristics of time series at different scales by calculating permutation entropy at multiple scales.
    It has a wide range of applications, especially in biomedicine, complex system analysis,
    financial markets and other fields, and can reveal the multi-level nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the system.
